Download the code & run **npm install** to install dependencies before starting the app.

I already installed Material UI as a dependency. using this Default installation commande from the MUI instructions webpage **npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled**

Also the Roboto font Using **npm install @fontsource/roboto**
